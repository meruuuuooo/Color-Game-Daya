# Color Game Daya

## Introduction
Color Game Daya, derived from the Tagalog word for "cheat," is a devious game designed to outsmart players and prevent them from winning. As the banker, I control the game and players place bets on their chosen color boxes. However, when a player selects three color boxes, the "Daya" feature is activated. This feature allows me to change the winning random color to one of the non-selected color boxes, making it even more challenging for players to win. Can you outsmart the game and emerge victorious?
